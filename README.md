## About

**üì∏ PicShare project was built as part of a coding challenge to demonstrate full-stack development skills. The task was to create a **modern Instagram-like photo sharing application** with full functionality in a limited timeframe.**

## Live Demo

**üîó [View Live Application](https://pics-share.vercel.app)**

*Demo version on Vercel with authentication disabled ‚Äî guest mode only.*

### Development Story

**Timeline:** Built in ~24 hours  
**Challenge:** Create a feature-complete demo social media app from scratch.
**Afterwards**, I made several commits (linter/formatter, cascading data deletion on profile removal, real-time updates) to harden the app.

**Development Process:**

- **v0.dev** - Used for rapid UI prototyping and component generation
- **Cursor + Claude** - AI-assisted development for debugging, optimization, and code refinement
- **Manual refinement** - Custom logic, performance optimizations, and UX improvements

### ‚ú® Key Features

- üîê **Authentication** - Email/password signup and login
- üì∏ **Photo Upload** - Drag & drop with file validation (5MB limit)
- üñºÔ∏è **Image Gallery** - Responsive grid layout with infinite scroll
- ‚ù§Ô∏è **Social Features** - Like and comment on posts in real-time
- üåô **Dark/Light Mode** - System preference support with manual toggle
- üì± **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach, works on all devices
- ‚ö° **Real-time Updates** - Live likes, comments, and new posts
- üé® **Modern UI** - Glassmorphism effects, smooth animations

### Tech Stack

**Frontend:**

- **Next.js 15** with App Router
- **TypeScript** (strict mode)
- **Tailwind CSS** + **shadcn/ui** components
- **React Hook Form** + **Zod** validation
- **Lucide React** icons

**Backend:**

- **Supabase** - Database, Auth, Storage, Real-time subscriptions
- **PostgreSQL** with Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Supabase Storage** for image hosting

**Performance & UX:**

- Image optimization with `next/image`
- Component memoization for performance
- Loading states and skeleton components
- Error boundaries and proper error handling

## Architecture Highlights

- **Clean separation of concerns** - hooks/, components/, lib/ structure
- **Custom React hooks** - Reusable business logic
- **TypeScript interfaces** - Full type safety throughout
- **Performance optimized** - Memoized components, lazy loading
- **Real-time architecture** - Supabase subscriptions for live updates
